# Policies

This repository houses a selection of default policies utilized for the validation and generation of Dockerfiles and Kubernetes-related manifests using the [genval](https://github.com/intelops/genval) tool.

Within this repository, you'll discover Rego policies in .rego format designed for validating input JSON and generated Dockerfiles. Additionally, it includes schema definitions in [Cuelang](https://cuelang.org/doc) format for validating Kubernetes and custom resource definitions (CRDs).

If you believe that this repository should include more comprehensive policies, please don't hesitate to contribute by submitting a Pull Request. If you encounter any discrepancies or issues, kindly open a GitHub issue to help us track and address them.
